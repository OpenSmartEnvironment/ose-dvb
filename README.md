# Open Smart Environment - DVB
This package is a part of the OSE suite.
All packages can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/opensmartenvironment/).

The main advantage of OSE is the easy creation of applications
consisting of multiple instances that work as a single whole. The
objective is to develop an all-encompassing personal mesh running
on various devices including HTPCs, phones, tablets, workstations,
servers, Raspberry Pis, home automation gadgets, wearables, drones
etc.

For more information about OSE see **the [documentation](http://opensmartenvironment.github.io/doc/)**.

## Status

This is not yet a piece of download-and-use software. It is important
